# AI Mock Interview

Practice job interviews out loud with an AI interviewer, then get feedback on how you did.

You set up an interview by choosing the role, difficulty, focus area, length and style. An AI interviewer then runs the session by voice. It asks questions, listens to your answers and follows up the way a real interviewer would. When you finish, you get a breakdown of how each answer went and what to work on next.

There is also a copilot mode for real interviews. It listens to your mic and the call audio, transcribes both sides live and suggests answers as the conversation goes.

## What it does

- Runs mock interviews by voice. The interviewer asks questions out loud using ElevenLabs, and your answers are transcribed with Deepgram.
- Gives every session a different interviewer with their own name and personality, so practice doesn't feel the same each time.
- Scores each interview and leaves notes on every answer. Your past interviews stay in your history so you can see if you're improving.
- Helps during real interviews with the copilot. It listens to your mic and the call audio, shows a live transcript and suggests what to say.
- Fills in your profile from an uploaded resume (PDF or Word).
- Has a short personality quiz that suggests your work style.
- Lets you search for jobs through the Adzuna API.
- Supports email sign up with verification, Google sign in and password reset.
- Handles paid plans through Stripe. There are Starter, Pro and Unlimited plans, each with its own usage limits.
- Comes with an admin panel for managing users, credits and plans, watching live sessions, editing questions and prompts, and exporting reports.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with Google and email/password sign in
- PostgreSQL on Neon with Drizzle ORM
- OpenAI and Google Gemini for questions, feedback and suggestions
- Deepgram for speech to text and ElevenLabs for text to speech
- Stripe for payments, SendGrid and Resend for email

## Getting started

You will need Node.js 18 or newer, a Postgres database (Neon works well) and API keys for the services listed above.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-pro017/AI-Mock-Interview.git
cd AI-Mock-Interview
npm install
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

`.env.example` lists every variable the app reads, grouped by service (database, auth, AI and voice, email, Stripe and app URLs). The Adzuna keys and question count at the bottom are optional. You can generate `AUTH_SECRET` by running `npx auth secret`.

Create the tables and load the subscription plans:

```bash
npm run db:push
node scripts/initAdminTables.js
node scripts/initSubscriptionPlans.js
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

To make an account an admin, sign up with it first and then run:

```bash
node scripts/makeUserAdmin.js you@example.com
```

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm start` | Run the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run the linter |
| `npm run db:push` | Push the Drizzle schema to the database |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio |

## Deployment

The app is built for Vercel, but Git deployments are turned off. `vercel.json` sets
`git.deploymentEnabled` to `false`, so pushing to `main` does not ship anything. Deploys are manual.

Deploy with the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel link        # once, to connect this folder to the Vercel project
vercel --prod      # build and deploy to production
```

Before the first deploy, copy every variable from `.env.example` into the Vercel project settings.
The three app URLs default to localhost and have to point at your deployed domain:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

Point your Stripe webhook at `https://your-domain.com/api/subscriptions/webhook` and put its
signing secret in `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Migrations do not run during the Vercel build. When the schema changes, run `npm run db:push`
against the production database yourself.

To turn automatic deploys back on, set `deploymentEnabled` to `true` in `vercel.json`, or remove
the `git` block entirely.
